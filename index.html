                <p>Hey there!

                    I'm Saptarshi Mandal, an M.Tech student at  Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore working at the SPECTRUM Lab headed by Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula .
                    Primarily, I focus on signal processing, especially within the domains of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and image/signal processing. 
                    This involves exploring various projects and research endeavors related to these fields, such as human activity recognition, user identification from smartphone sensor data, image reconstruction, and human face detection in poor-quality images.
                    My main coding language is Python, and I extensively utilize libraries like PyTorch, Keras, and TensorFlow for deep learning tasks.
                    Through my work, I've contributed to reasearch papers that have been accepted and published in respected peer-reviewed journals.  </p>
